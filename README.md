# Tech Echo Collective

The production website for Tech Echo Collective: a GitHub-authenticated member
gateway, a multilingual dashboard with project attribution and member identity,
and one forum backed by the existing `Tech-Echo-Collective/Tech-Echo-Discussion`
GitHub Discussions repository.

## Tech Echo Physica

[Tech Echo Physica](https://techecho.org/projects#tech-echo-physica) is a Tech Echo Collective project family for exploring physics through research mapping, knowledge structures, and interactive physical systems.

- [Atlas Physicus](https://github.com/Tech-Echo-Collective/atlas-physicus): archived on 12 September 2026; the interactive research map and 8 September data snapshot remain available, with no further active development or data updates.
- [Illuminatio Physica](https://github.com/Tech-Echo-Collective/illuminatio-physica): knowledge structures.
- [Theatrum Physicum](https://github.com/Tech-Echo-Collective/theatrum-physicum): interactive physical systems, in early development.

Each remains a distinct project with its existing ownership and contributor attribution. See the [rename audit](docs/PHYSICA_RENAME.md) for repository and compatibility details.

## Product flow

```text
techecho.org gateway
  -> GitHub App user authorization
  -> explicit membership confirmation
  -> permanent Tech Echo Member #
  -> authenticated techecho.org/home
  -> projects, members, and README-backed organization context
  -> one multilingual forum.techecho.org forum
  -> GitHub Discussions as the only post/comment source of truth
```

There are no Tech Echo passwords and no custom forum-content database. The D1
database stores only member identity, encrypted GitHub credentials, sessions,
short-lived OAuth and pending-registration state, one-time cross-domain sign-in
handoffs, and rate-limit counters, plus a bounded cache of public GitHub
contributor metadata. Account and
forum sessions use separate host-only cookies and are tied to the same device
session family for logout.

Production operations include a no-side-effect health check and smoke monitor,
plus a daily encrypted 90-day durable identity backup. The snapshot preserves
permanent Member Numbers, member profiles, encrypted GitHub credentials, and the
allocation high-water mark while deliberately excluding replayable session and
OAuth state. Recovery remains a reviewed, isolated, manual operation.

## Local development

Requirements: Node.js 22.13 or newer.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill the server-side values.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the local application with `npm run dev`.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Useful checks:

```sh
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test
npm run build
npm audit --omit=dev
```

Without GitHub App credentials, the public gateway and legal pages still render,
but GitHub sign-in intentionally stops with a configuration message.

## Canonical community backend

- Organization: <https://github.com/Tech-Echo-Collective>
- Forum repository: <https://github.com/Tech-Echo-Collective/Tech-Echo-Discussion>
- Community Discussions: <https://github.com/orgs/Tech-Echo-Collective/discussions>

The forum repository is public. Content remains publicly readable on GitHub, and
people can also participate directly through GitHub. A GitHub author who has not
joined Tech Echo is shown as a GitHub participant without a Tech Echo Member #.
